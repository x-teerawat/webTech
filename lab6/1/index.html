                <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various
                    kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
                    Most programming languages consist of instructions for computer</p>

                <h1>C</h1>
                <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
                    lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs
                    that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.</p>

                <h1>Pytohn</h1>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
                    Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
                    notable use of significant whitespace.</p>

                <h1>Java</h1>
                <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                    implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
